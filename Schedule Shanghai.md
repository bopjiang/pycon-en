Opening Speech & Schedule Introducing

Using Python for efficient big data workflows and task scheduling
9: 10-9: 55  Ding Laiqiang
Now Big Data technology is very popular, workflow and task scheduling is an integral part, this topic focuses on pure-Python Apache Airflow and Spotify Luigi program, covering the adjustment problem, Principle, tool extensions, and best practices future development. Also it relates to the other non-Python solutions such as Linkedin Azkaban, Apache Oozie like.

Python High Performance Web Services Development Practices
9: 55-10: 40 Zhu Jinliang
Business with the rapid growth of business scale, in a year from zero to one million. and PaiLeQU grow from zero to one million single process in three monthes, the back-end system constantly optimize the evolution of the road, as well as performance optimization solutions.

Coffee Break
10: 40-10: 50

Talk about Python and Quantitative Investment
10: 50-11: 35 Chen Xiaoyou
Talk about quantitative investment ,which is popular of the domestic Python application areas: 1. What is the quantitative investment management and quantitative investment institutions 2. The method of billions of funds and retail last year, a guest stocks mentioned in Python what is the way 3. Some pain points difference quantization traders encounter in their work and Python solution 4. Python currently targeting ecosystem and tool chain 5. vn.py quantitative investment projects in the area of ​​the entire tool chain

Python Debug
11: 35-11: 45 Guo Haochuan
Quick share about how do I use Python in Eleme, the questions I met and the solutions. 1. Introduction performance optimize and several solutions under gevent environment. 2. Share some ways to hang into the python process, execute command python debugging.

Embedded Software Automation Testing Practices and Examples
11: 45-11: 55 Ouyang Min
Topic Description 1) The difference about urban rail embedded software test automation 2) Urban rail embedded software test automation test framework 3) Application Example: interlock carrying a communication interface with vehicle tests, node test platforms include: Platform management, car simulation, simulation IO, simulation SDM (System Diagnosis Maintenance), the test agent. Diagnostic data software provides a cycle for the results of the automatic analysis function module, according to the diagnostic data format definition file testers, the platform parse out the contents of the diagnostic data. Automatic analysis of the script by testing to define a specific format, easy access to the value of the data from the test data recorded and used for inspection and analysis of relevant rules. After parsing module parses scripts into executable code and automatically delivered to the analysis module performs and gives automatic analysis results.

Python Data Visualization Applications
13: 00-13: 45 Jackon
Based on several practical projects, present data visualization application and the value. Mainly from two perspectives: Visualization and matplotlib 1. mathematical functions.  Summary: The nature of the data analysis is to find a function of data between function and make the image. 2. Visualization and igraph network topology. Data is not isolated, the data network is structured. Network topology is difficult to counterfeit and easy to clean. You can find very valuable information. Projects: 1. Server performance monitoring filtering and visualization - visualization of statistical data to identify the naked eye is difficult to identify an important bug. 2. Lottery K line graph - random data visualization, monitoring does not meet the statistical law of outliers. 3. The friendships network visualization - Find secret confidante.

Python and Big Data Computing Platform
13: 45-14: 30 Qin Xuye
Existing pandas library provides a rich API especially DataFrame API to manipulate structured data; while Ali cloud ODPS itself as a large data processing platform provides the ability to huge amounts of data, which is on ODPS main ODPS SQL structured data manipulation language . However, Pandas as a standalone library, computing power is limited; ODPS SQL can handle large amounts of data, but limited to the expression of SQL. Therefore, PyODPS DataFrame framework provides API similar Pandas DataFrame one kind, but can use ODPS mass data computing capability, the structure of the data can execute the query. DataFrame framework will now be translated into all operations performed ODPS SQL, it can also be used to calculate the local pandas. Meanwhile, PyODPS provides similar scikit-learn similar interface, through the input and output PyODPS DataFrame, allows users without having to learn the cost, you can use similar scikit-learn experience of machine learning and data mining.

Asyncio in Web Technology Stack
14: 45-15: 30  Li Junshun
In Python3.4, asyncio is officially entered as a standard library, people placed a lot of expectations. In Python3.5 version, PEP-0492 introduce the async / await grammar, letting asyncio intuitive further. But now look at Python Web Development with Django is still the most development-oriented, Can asyncio run in a production environment ? How to make better use of asynchronous application performance advantages contribute? This is an instructive lecture wants to give.

TensorFlow Analysis and Application Framework
16: 15-17: 00 Wang Chen
Artificial intelligence is one of the most popular computer science research, AlphaGo beating Shishi, Prisma swepting the major social networks, have shown that the third wave is coming. Google is one of the directions of artificial intelligence leader, in 2015, Google opened machine learning framework TensorFlow to public. Upon release, quickly became one of the project was the most attention on github, but also become the most commonly used standard framework in the field of machine learning. This presentation would like to share our TensorFlow framework research and analysis with you, and hope that through a better understanding of the framework itself, promote more application projects faster and better landing practice.
