Python and Design Pattern
丁来强
Desgin pattern is always one of the most popular topics. In OOP programming laguages, the 23 patterns of GOF are especially popular. How could these patterns being applied and modified in Python applications? This session will explore common design patterns used in Pattern and try to find the application and implementation of desgin pattern in Python from functional programming aspect. Networking and parallel pattern will be covered as well.

10:40-10:50 Tea break

Infrastructure as Code In Aliyun
田涛涛
As more and more IT infrastructures move to cloud, we need more convenient solution to lower the entrance expense of cloud service, more ordered management of resource and configuration to create resource and runtime environment in reusable manner. In Python community, such automatic management tools like Ansible can help. We will use Ansible as an example to show how Aliyun's ROS service create cloud resource and deliver application in a standard way, which is Infrastructure as Code in cloud.

Build infrastructure in the architecture of service with Python
张华翼
1. Distributed tracking system: in the architecture of service, the call chain can be very complex. We can implement a compact and transparent distributed tracking system with the help of Python dynamic features which will collect callstack information and locate performance bottlenecks.
2. Dynamic interface query engine: in the migration to the architecture of service, we will encounter performance issues and  interface design granularity problems. We can combine multiple calls of service in one service call or dynamically combine several existing interfaces to generate a new interface, using data flow abstraction and Python closure serialization.

13:45-14:30
Smart data pipeline task schedule system
阳曙光
A variety of tasks will run in the data pipeline, such as Hive SQL, MR program, Python data processing script, data export, SMTP, etc. It's a big challenge to ensure execution in order of task dependency. The task schedule system developed in Python can solve dependency problem automatically and schedule tasks in order of priority. It provides data recovery and partial execution which can help solve the problems caused by upstream data.

14:30-14:45 Tea break

A two-dimension foil(二向箔) please for analysis
-- Multi-dimension data visualization with Python
莫瑜
High-dimensional data is very common in the application of big data and artificial intelligence. For example, we need to encode textual and graphics data into high dimension vectors. However, it's very difficult for people who living in the 3-dimension world to understand high dimension data. It's the routine work to visualize high dimension data, which can help data analysis and optimization. 
The readers of "the Three-Body Problem(三体)" must be familiar with the black magic -- the two-dimension foil. To a great extent, the visualization of high-dimensional data is the process of dimension reduction to show distribution of high dimension data.
This session will share several methods and practices of high dimension data visualization.

15:30-16:15
Fast building block chain service platform
杨保华
Block chain is one of the key innovations in financial technology(Fintech). As the core technology of decentralization accounting(DLT) platform, block chain is considered having an extensive application prospect in a variety of areas, such as asset management, financial credit reporting, IOT(Internet of Things), economic trade settlement, etc. The bank and IT giants have established many opensource projects, which try to accelerate the development of block chain technology and its application. How to quickly build the block chain platform and develop applications based of block chain is the key problem to solve.
IBM is the leading enterprise in field of chain block. It has opensourced many chain block projects of 40,000 lines code and established a number of chain block laboratories. In this session, we'll introduce the block chain service platform developed in Python. This project, as the core engine of block chain cloud service, has been online for half a year, with which thousands of block chain runs steadily. We'll cover core features, development and operation best practices of this platform with sample demonstration.

16:15-17:00
使用 Python 将系统运维产品化
Producibility of system operation with Python
王玉驰
In this session, we'll introduce the practices of the system operation producibility in Zhihu with tools based on Python.
1 The process of the system operation platform of Zhihu built from scratch; Our adoption of Python stack and technology selection afterwards.
2 The unification of separated tools into one platform, such as saltstack, fabric, pxe, etc.
3 The system operation instructions summed up in the process.

17:00-17:45
Explode your productivity
-- Mining the potential of Django
吕召刚
The Admin module of Django is so powerful, with which we can develop management system efficiently. How can we become more efficient? For example, how can we finish a system planned two week development in one day? Why shall we redefine the model once again if the database already has the definition? In this session, we'll share the experience of automatic code generation, the integration of existing system database and accounts, the customization of new features with default admin page, the integration of bootstrap and restapi. If you are interested in this session, please make sure to bring your laptop and get Django installed. You'll get the most in this session.
