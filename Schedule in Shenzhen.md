10:00-10:45 
Scripted and Blockly visualization application development practice
潘俊勇
With the fast change of technology, application development increases in complexity and lacks of lasting security. The '易开发(easydo)' has simplified application development and achieved sustainable development in enterprise application development, by establishing application development platform, shielding technical changes and accomplishing full-stack scripted Python application development, in which part of the logic is developed with Blockly visualization application development.

10:45-11:30
Python hooking, patching and injection
丁来强
The powerful features of Python language features and ecosystem provide strong support for efficient development and data analysis. The language flexibility also make it possible for hacking, with which many powerful magical tools and patterns have been produced. In this session, we'll give the details of technologies and principles of Python hooking, patching and injection. Audiences can learn related technologies and understand application scenarios, with popular framework & libraries usage and tools, security, detection scenario.

11:30-12:15
Python in public cloud system practice
李力
As we know, Python is one of the best friends of cloud computing. OpenStack has set up a series of large projects with Python. Tecent uses Python a a lot in its background system as well. In this session, we'll share some good application practices of Python in Tecent public cloud system. Also, we'll elaborate our dependency and love of some Python features in cloud computing system and share the traps and pitfalls of Python programming in large system.


Noon

12:15-13:15 Lunch

Afternoon

13:15-14:00
Python in Android
river
Why and how to use Python in Android development? This is the doubt of many Python developers. In this session, I'll share the application scenario of Python development in Android, including 1 How to do Android programming in Python? 2 How to develop native App & WebApp in Python? 3 How to do game development in Python?

14:00-14:45
Finally, Python got the draft of ASGI
何世友
It has been more than 10 years since CGI evloved to WSGI. Since 2010, protocols like HTTP, WebSocket have grown over time. Apparently WSGI has already fall down. Python is in urgent need of the new web framework to adapt to the new protocols.
Initiated by Diango team, ASGI proposed a new asynchronize network programing model, trying to handle HTTP/HTTP2/Websocket protocols in one framework. How does ASGI work? Let's try to understand the mechanism behind it. 

14:45-15:00 Tea break

Automatic operations and tools
15:00-15:45 张其川
In the era of big data and cloud computing, more and more companies began expand their business. At the same time, the number of servers has increased dramatically. With such a large cluster of servers, normal operation mode can not satisfy the production needs. We need automatic operation to achieve better efficience of server management. This session will give some automatic operation development cases and practices.

15:45-16:30
Opensource of WEGO
胡国涛
With the development of WeChat, the increasing of WeChat Official Account registrations have generated a large demand of WeChat development. Now, we have opensourced our WeChat development framework WEGO, hoping this will bring more convenience to more developers.
WEGO is a light, fast, flexible, easy to use WeChat development framework, written in Python.
It has a off the shelf web management portal which let developers concentrate on business logic and get rid of WeChat interface debugging.

16:30-16:40
Improve your work efficient with Python assisted development software
馋师
1 Develop a hotkey software in Python, which supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS, better than AutoHotkey.
2 Work out code workflow in a short time (10 minutes per framework) and implement non-invasive process test (no event tracking or test specific function parameters) by tracking runtime call stack with Monkey Patching.
3 Express code intention with line by line comment, multiplying code readability and project maintenance.

16:40-16:50
A visual crawler technology
石恩名
Network crawler is Python's best known field. There are dozens of opensource Python crawler framework, like Scrapy, Pyspider, etc. How to build a high performance visualization web crawler product with existing frameworks? 
1 Introduction to a high performance web crawler.
2 The problems of building a visualization web crawler.
3 Solutions to the major problems.
4 Product demonstration and introduction.

16:50-17:00
Big data monitoring alarm system
汤英康
With rapid increase of business volume and data, monitoring and alarm of cluster application appears increasingly important. 优亿科技(useease) introduced a complete set of big data monitoring alarm platform solution, by integration of distributed data acquisition, data visualization, alarm and Docker cluster management technology, combined with years of telecommunications big data project experience.
In this session, we'll introduce the architecture of this platform and share the experience of design and development.

17:00-17:10 Lucky draw & photo
